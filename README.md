# CanopyCover
Python code to compute canopy cover attributes
Files library_cc.py and main_cc.py are files modified from CaCo(https://pypi.org/project/caco/) to provide all the canopy cover attributes. Once you pip install CaCo, you should replace these files in CaCo.caco run.py is an example of using the modified CaCo software. 
Remaining Python files are independent machine learning algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors) to compute canopy cover attributes.
CaCo is based on the paper: A. Alivernini, S. Fares, C. Ferrara, and F. Chianucci, “An objective image analysis method for estimation of canopy attributes from digital cover photography,” Trees - Struct. Funct., vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 713–723, 2018, doi: 10.1007/s00468-018-1666-3
